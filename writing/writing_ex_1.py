# Writing the Data to the File
# To write the Data to the File, we have Two Pre-Defined Functions Present in File Pointer Object. They are
#     1. write()      --> Syntax:   FilePointerObj.write(str-data)                  ,If we have non-str Data then we convert the non-str data into str type data by using str()
#     2. writelines() --> Syntax:   FilePointerObj.writelines(Iterable-Object Data) ,If we have non-str Data then we convert the non-str data into str type data by using str()
